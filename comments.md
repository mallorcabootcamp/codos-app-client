- Use FunctionComponent to type components
- IconWithValue: Use icon as a a prop (enum) avoid using an string
- Have classnames (library) in count!

- Compare load times with bootstrap full and with only the bits you need
- Loading: use enum for color
- Remove unused files
- Use container class in main
- In main: can we change useState for useReducer
- useCallback (when a function is passed as parameter of other component)
- Consider removing 20 magic number in chart props
- Consider including calculateTimeScaleValue inside ApiService (then moving it out from utils)
- Grey screen should fill all the horizontal space. 
- Limit container width: 900px (instead of 120X) from bootstrap
